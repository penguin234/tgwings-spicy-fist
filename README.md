Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a man named Kihyun Lim at Kyung Hee University. Though he possessed the spiciest fists in all the world, he chose to keep his power hidden, living a quiet and secluded life.

But one fateful day, the library app at his university became unbearably slow, and his fists began to burn with anger. Unable to stand it any longer, his hidden power was about to erupt.

To prevent the end of the world, we decided to create a faster library app.


Now, the fate of humanity rests in our handsâ€¦
